                It is a period of civil war. The Woods Rebels, striking from the Quai 10, have won their first victories against the Web Dev World.

            <p>
                During the battle, the Woods managed to learn HTML and CSS. While they were still struggling with SASS and Responsiv path and starting the Bootstrap of death path, the most popular CSS framework, the moving strikes hard with enough power to destroy an entire cohesion.

                Pursued by the Post-buildingâ€™s sinister agents, Woods race home aboard their full glass starship, while Arnaud, the most beloved coach in the universe try to instore unity between Becode and A6K-E6K. The path that seperates the Woods from the hill is just a short week long and there is still soooo much to learn...
