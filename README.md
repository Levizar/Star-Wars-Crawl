# Star Wars Crawl exercise #

This ripository contain an exercise realised during my internship at Becode.

I made it later so I've made it with SASS.

So I used the SASS import fonction to use a "complex" background I've made for my [404 project](https://levizar.github.io/404/).

Here is the link of [my Star Wars style Crawl](https://levizar.github.io/Star-Wars-Crawl/)
